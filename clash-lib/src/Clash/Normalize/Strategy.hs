-- [Note: bottomup traversal evalConst]
--
-- 2-May-2019: There is a bug in the evaluator where all data constructors are
-- considered lazy, even though their declaration says they have strict fields.
-- This causes some reductions to fail because the term under the constructor is
-- not in WHNF, which is what some of the evaluation rules for certain primitive
-- operations expect. Using a bottom-up traversal works around this bug by
-- ensuring that the values under the constructor are in WHNF.
--
-- Using a bottomup traversal ensures that constants are reduced to NF, even if
-- constructors are lazy, thus ensuring more sensible/smaller generated HDL.

{- [Note] bottom-up traversal for liftNonRep
We used to say:

"The liftNonRep transformation must be applied in a topDown traversal because
of what Clash considers tail calls in its join-point analysis."

Consider:

> let fail = \x -> ...
> in  case ... of
>       A -> let fail1 = \y -> case ... of
>                                 X -> fail ...
>                                 Y -> ...
>            in case ... of
>                 P -> fail1 ...
>                 Q -> ...
>       B -> fail ...

under "normal" tail call rules, the local 'fail' functions is not a join-point
because it is used in a let-binding. However, we apply "special" tail call rules
in Clash. Because 'fail' is used in a TC position within 'fail1', and 'fail1' is
only used in a TC position, in Clash, we consider 'tail' also only to be used
in a TC position.

Now image we apply 'liftNonRep' in a bottom up traversal, we will end up with:

> fail1 = \fail y -> case ... of
>   X -> fail ...
>   Y -> ...

> let fail = \x -> ...
> in  case ... of
>       A -> case ... of
>                 P -> fail1 fail ...
>                 Q -> ...
>       B -> fail ...

Suddenly, 'fail' ends up in an argument position, because it occurred as a
_locally_ bound variable within 'fail1'. And because of that 'fail' stops being
a join-point.

However, when we apply 'liftNonRep' in a top down traversal we end up with:

> fail = \x -> ...
>
> fail1 = \y -> case ... of
>   X -> fail ...
>   Y -> ...
>
> let ...
> in  case ... of
>       A -> let
>            in case ... of
>                 P -> fail1 ...
>                 Q -> ...
>       B -> fail ...

and all is well with the world.

UPDATE:
We can now just perform liftNonRep in a bottom-up traversal again, because
liftNonRep no longer checks that if the binding that is lifted is a join-point.
However, for this to work, bindNonRep must always have been exhaustively applied
before liftNonRep. See also: [Note] bindNonRep before liftNonRep.
-}

{- [Note] bindNonRep before liftNonRep
The combination of liftNonRep and nonRepSpec can lead to non-termination in an
unchecked rewrite system (without termination measures in place) on the
following:

> main = f not
> f    = \a x -> (a x) && (f a x)

nonRepSpec will lead to:

> main = f'
> f    = \a x -> (a x) && (f a x)
> f'   = (\a x -> (a x) && (f a x)) not

then lamApp leads to:

> main = f'
> f    = \a x -> (a x) && (f a x)
> f'   = let a = not in (\x -> (a x) && (f a x))

then liftNonRep leads to:

> main = f'
> f    = \a x -> (a x) && (f a x)
> f'   = \x -> (g x) && (f g x)
> g    = not

and nonRepSepc leads to:

> main = f'
> f    = \a x -> (a x) && (f a x)
> f'   = \x -> (g x) && (f'' g x)
> g    = not
> f''  = (\a x -> (a x) && (f a x)) g

This cycle continues indefinitely, as liftNonRep creates a new global variable,
which is never alpha-equivalent to the previous global variable introduced by
liftNonRep.

That is why bindNonRep must always be applied before liftNonRep. When we end up
in the situation after lamApp:

> main = f'
> f    = \a x -> (a x) && (f a x)
> f'   = let a = not in (\x -> (a x) && (f a x))

bindNonRep will now lead to:

> main = f'
> f    = \a x -> (a x) && (f a x)
> f'   = \x -> (not x) && (f not x)

Because `f` has already been specialized on the alpha-equivalent-to-itself `not`
function, liftNonRep leads to:

> main = f'
> f    = \a x -> (a x) && (f a x)
> f'   = \x -> (not x) && (f' x)

And there is no non-terminating rewriting cycle.

That is why bindNonRep must always be exhaustively applied before we apply
liftNonRep.
